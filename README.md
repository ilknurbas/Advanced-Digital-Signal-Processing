# Advanced Digital Signal Processing
 This repository contains implementations related to digital holography and signal processing.
 
 Topics covered:
 
  **`#1:` Characterizing holographic displays via numerical simulations**
   
   This section focuses on the use of numerical simulations to characterize **holographic displays**, specifically for analyzing **accommodation cues** in near-eye displays. The task involves simulating the viewing process of the hologram, including **field diffraction** and a simplified **computational eye model**. The implementation uses MATLAB to simulate the **light propagation**, calculate retinal images, and assess the **perceived sharpness** of displayed content by adjusting focal distances. The implementation includes synthesizing holograms using **Fresnel** and **Rayleigh-Sommerfeld** diffraction kernels, as well as propagating light towards the retina to form retinal images. Key aspects include **retinal image formation, point spread function (PSF)** analysis, and determining the **modulation transfer function (MTF)** as a function of focal distances. Note that some sections of the code are based on templates provided.

  **`#2:` Signal Processing in Digital Holography**

  This section explores signal processing techniques used in off-axis digital holography. It focuses on the application of **Fourier transforms, 2D Fourier filtering, and angular spectrum wavefront propagation** to reconstruct high-quality 3D images from 2D holographic data. Key methods include spatial frequency separation for wavefront recovery and the use of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld model for back-propagation to the object plane.
